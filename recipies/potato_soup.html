    <h2>Delicious Ham and Potato Soup</h2>
    <p>This is a delicious recipe for ham and potato soup 
        that a friend gave to me. It is very easy and the 
        great thing about it is that you can add additional 
        ingredients, more ham, potatoes, etc and it still 
        turns out great.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 1/2 cups of peeled and diced potatoes</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of diced celery</li>
            <li>1/3 cup finely chopped onion</li>
            <li>3/4 cup diced cooked ham</li>
            <li>3 1/4 cups of water</li>
            <li>2 tbs chicken bouillon granules</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the potatoes, celery, onion, ham and 
                water in a stockpot. Bring to a boil, then cook 
                over medium heat until potatoes are tender, about 
                10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the chicken bouillon, 
                salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>n a separate saucepan, melt butter over 
                medium-low heat. Whisk in flour with a fork, 
                and cook, stirring constantly until thick, about
                 1 minute. Slowly stir in milk as not to allow 
                 lumps to form until all of the milk has been
                  added. Continue stirring over medium-low heat 
                  until thick, 4 to 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Stir the milk mixture into the stockpot, 
                and cook soup until heated through. Serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
