Hello my name is Johnny. This is my first project in Odin working with HTML.
I will have to demonstrate that I know how to set up a boilerplate for HTML, add text, heading, minipulate paragraphs with bold and emphasis and also use lists. I will also have to add links and images to the page as well. In the end I hope to have a bsic understanding of HTML and how to set up a bsaic shell of a website that will be further enhanced with CSS when I learn it.

End Of project:
